# PRESENTATION STRUCTURE (Following the Photo Guidelines)

---

## PART 1: STORY (Opening - Set the Scene)

---

### SLIDE 1: Background + The Problem Is...

**Opening Hook (pick one):**
> "Imagine getting your first salary... and by the 20th of the month, it's all gone. In our survey of 30 young Nepalis, 76% had no formal budgeting system -- they either plan loosely in their head or don't plan at all. And 73% have postponed a financial decision simply because they didn't understand their options."

> OR: Use a direct respondent quote -- "Before the end of my month, salary gets collapsed in unnecessary things, so I never thought about it." That's a real person in our survey. And they're not alone.

**The Background:**
- Nepal ranks **136th out of 144 countries** in global financial literacy (Thapa & Nepal, 2015)
- **71.67%** of Kathmandu-based youth don't understand how budgeting helps achieve goals (Dangol & Maharjan, 2018)
- Even management students score only **2.4 out of 5** in practical financial literacy (Adhikari, 2018)
- Only **13.33%** of management students understand personal financial planning
- **71.83%** of the population rely on family and friends for financial needs (NRB Survey)

**The Problem Statement:**
> "Young adults in Nepal (18-25) are making critical financial decisions -- about savings, investments, loans, and future planning -- without adequate knowledge, tools, or personalized guidance. Existing solutions are either too generic, not localized for Nepal, or too complex. The result? Decision paralysis, poor financial habits, and missed opportunities."

---

## PART 2: INFOGRAPHICS SECTION (Evidence & Analysis)

---

### SLIDE 2: "We Talked To..." (User Analysis)

**Method:**
- Conducted a focused survey with **30 respondents** (ages 18-25)
- Conducted **in-depth interviews** with **11 individuals** + 2 detailed interviews (abroad student, startup founder)

**Present as infographic - "5 Key Insights from Our Users":**

**INSIGHT 1: No One Plans Formally**

- 43% "roughly plan in their head" | 33% spend without any plan

### SLIDE 3: "The Organizations/Individuals Working in This..." (Competitor Analysis)

**Present as a comparison table/infographic:**

| Competitor | What They Offer | What They DON'T Offer |
|---|---|---|
| **Money Mitra** (Market Leader) | Nepal-focused stock/portfolio tracking, budgeting module, market data | No personalization, no AI interaction, no financial simulations, buggy app |
| **Cleo** (International) | AI chat for spending tracking, gamified budgeting | No Nepal context, no literacy education, no long-term planning |
| **NRB Training** | Professional banking workshops, certifications | Not consumer-facing, no youth focus, no digital tool |
| **YNAB** | Proactive budgeting philosophy, education | Paid subscription, steep learning curve, no Nepal context |
| **Khan Academy** | Free financial courses, video lessons | Not interactive, no personalization, no Nepal localization |
| **Investopedia** | Massive knowledge library | Text-only, static, no personalization, no Nepal context |
| **ChatGPT/Google** | General AI answers | Not localized, no structured guidance, no financial simulations |
| **Chukul** | AI-driven NEPSE analysis | Only stock market focused, not holistic financial literacy |

**The Gap (KEY POINT):**
> "No existing tool combines: (1) Nepal-specific context, (2) Personalized AI guidance, (3) Financial simulations/projections, and (4) Step-by-step beginner-friendly education -- all in one platform."

**Visual suggestion:** Show a Venn diagram or gap matrix with these 4 elements, showing competitors covering only 1-2 each.

---

### SLIDE 4: "When We Studied the Problem..." (Policy/Problem Analysis - PESTEL)

**PESTEL Summary (with positive sides):**

| Factor | The Problem | However... (Positive Side) |
|---|---|---|
| **Political** | No systematic financial education mandated in curricula | Nepal Rastra Bank actively promotes financial inclusion; government supports digital Nepal |
| **Economic** | Rising living costs; youth wages too low to save meaningfully | Increasing workforce participation; growing demand for personal financial planning |
| **Social** | 71.83% rely on family/friends; low literacy; financial taboo | Growing youth awareness; increasing desire to learn (84% of our respondents want clearer tools) |
| **Technological** | Limited open financial data; digital divide in rural areas | Growing smartphone penetration; cloud/AI tech available; digital payments expanding (eSewa, Khalti) |
| **Environmental** | Minimal direct impact | Digital/paperless solution = environmentally positive |
| **Legal** | Cannot give direct financial advice legally | Can provide educational guidance + simulations = our design already accommodates this |

**Key policy finding:**
> "The problem primarily lies in the SOCIAL dimension -- Nepalese college students lack deep financial knowledge in credit, taxes, insurance, and capital markets. But political and technological conditions are FAVORABLE for a solution right now."

---

### SLIDE 5: "Then We Decided We Need to Focus On..." (Our Solution)

**Our Focus:**
> "After analyzing 30 survey responses, 11 discussion interviews, 2 deep interviews, competitor landscape, and PESTEL factors, we identified the core need: **Young Nepalis don't need more generic information -- they need a personalized, simple, Nepal-specific platform that shows them the consequences of their financial choices.**"

### OPTION 1 (Primary -- Detail This): AI-Powered Financial Literacy & Guidance Platform

**Name suggestion:** (Your team can decide -- something Nepali-friendly)

**How It Works (Step by Step):**

1. **User Onboarding:** User signs up, answers simple questions about age, income, goals (study abroad? save? invest? start business?), and financial comfort level

2. **Personalized Dashboard:** Based on their profile, they see:
   - Their financial health snapshot
   - Recommended learning modules (beginner to advanced)
   - Goal tracker (e.g., "Save Rs. 5 lakh for abroad in 18 months")

3. **AI Conversational Guide:** A chatbot that:
   - Answers financial questions in simple Nepali/English
   - Explains concepts like a friend would ("What is a mutual fund? Think of it like a potluck...")
   - Provides Nepal-specific guidance (local bank rates, NEPSE basics, tax rules)

4. **Financial Simulators:**
   - "If I save Rs. 5,000/month at 8% interest, what will I have in 3 years?" -> Visual graph
   - "If I take a Rs. 10 lakh loan at 12% for 5 years, what are my EMIs?" -> Breakdown
   - "Should I invest in FD vs. Mutual Fund vs. Gold?" -> Side-by-side comparison

5. **Budgeting Tool:**
   - Simple income/expense tracker
   - Spending pattern analysis ("60% of your money goes to food & transport")
   - Smart alerts ("You've spent 80% of your budget by the 15th")

6. **Learning Modules (Gamified):**
   - Budgeting 101, Saving Strategies, Investment for Beginners
   - Credit Scores Explained, Loan Readiness Checklist
   - Study Abroad Financial Planning, Startup Finance Basics
   - Quizzes, badges, progress tracking

**Why This Works:**
- 40% asked for more education -> Learning modules
- 37% asked for simpler information -> AI explains like a friend
- 20% asked for expert guidance -> AI guide + simulators
- 20% asked for budgeting tools -> Built-in tracker
- 84% want consequence clarity -> Financial simulators

---

### OPTION 2 (Brief): Expense Tracking + Spending Pattern Analyzer

- Links to bank accounts/eSewa/Khalti
- Shows spending patterns across categories
- Alerts when overspending
- Simpler scope, but misses education/simulation component
- *Similar to:* Splitwise + Commonwealth Bank spending insights

---

### OPTION 3 (Brief): Financial Literacy Content Platform (Educational Focus Only)

- Curated Nepal-specific financial education content
- Video lessons, articles, quizzes
- No personalization, no AI, no simulations
- *Similar to:* Khan Academy but for Nepal
- Lower technical complexity but lower impact

---

**Why Option 1 is Best:**
> "Option 1 uniquely addresses ALL the pain points our research uncovered. Options 2 and 3 each solve only a slice of the problem."

| Pain Point | Option 1 | Option 2 | Option 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| No budget system (76%) | Yes | Yes | No |
| Decision paralysis (73%) | Yes (AI + Simulators) | No | Partially |
| Emotional overwhelm (70%) | Yes (step-by-step) | No | Partially |
| Want consequence clarity (84%) | Yes (Simulators) | No | No |
| Need Nepal-specific context | Yes | Partially | Yes |
