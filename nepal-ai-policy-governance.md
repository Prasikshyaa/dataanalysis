# Artificial Intelligence in Nepal: Policy, Governance, and the Path Forward

---

## 1. Introduction

At its simplest, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about machines doing things we used to think only humans could do -- recognising faces, translating languages, predicting weather, even writing essays. It's not magic. It's software built on data and algorithms, and it's already part of our daily lives whether we notice it or not. Every time someone in Kathmandu scrolls through TikTok or gets a loan approved through a fintech app, AI is working behind the scenes.

But here's the thing most people don't think about: AI isn't just a technology question. It's a governance question. Who decides how these systems work? Whose data feeds them? Who benefits, and who gets left out? For a country like Nepal -- a federal democratic republic still working through post-conflict institution-building, with a GDP per capita of around USD 1,300 and roughly 17% of its population living in multidimensional poverty -- these aren't abstract concerns (CBS, 2021). They're urgent.

I got interested in this topic after studying the AI governance module, and what struck me most was how much of the global conversation around AI assumes a certain level of infrastructure, institutional capacity, and economic power that countries like Nepal simply don't have. So this paper tries to do something specific: look at where Nepal actually stands on AI policy, what's at stake, and what realistic steps the government can take. My argument is straightforward -- Nepal can't afford to be a passive consumer of AI built elsewhere. It needs its own approach, one that fits its economy, its politics, and its people.

## 2. Nepal's Current Digital and AI Policy Landscape

Nepal's journey with digital governance has been slow. For a long time, the main piece of legislation was the **Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) 2063 (2008)**, which dealt with things like electronic signatures, cybercrime, and online transactions. It was decent for its time, but it was written well before anyone in Nepali policymaking was thinking about machine learning or algorithmic decision-making. It simply doesn't cover AI.

The **National ICT Policy 2015** pushed for e-governance and broadband expansion, but again, no mention of AI. Then came the **Digital Nepal Framework 2019**, put together with World Bank support, which identified eight sectors for digital transformation -- agriculture, health, education, energy, tourism, finance, urban infrastructure, and government services (World Bank, 2019). It was a step forward. But it mostly treated technology as a delivery tool. It didn't ask the harder questions: what happens when an algorithm makes a wrong decision about someone's credit? Who's accountable?

On the data protection front, Nepal does have the **Individual Privacy Act 2075 (2018)**, which provides some basic privacy protections. But it's limited -- it wasn't designed with AI, big data, or automated decision-making in mind. A more comprehensive **Draft Data Protection Bill** has been discussed for years but hasn't been enacted into law, leaving a significant gap in how personal data gets collected, stored, or used by AI systems (Privacy International, 2023).

Now, here's where things get interesting. In 2025, the Government of Nepal approved the **National Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Policy 2082**. This is a significant development. Nepal now has, at least on paper, a dedicated AI policy -- something that puts it ahead of several countries in the region. The policy talks about using AI for economic growth, improving public services, and building domestic AI capacity. It also touches on ethical use, data governance, and the need for institutional coordination (Government of Nepal, 2025). I'll be honest -- when I first heard about it, I was surprised. Nepal isn't exactly a country people associate with AI strategy. But the policy exists, and the real question now is implementation.

Institutionally, the **Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT)** and the **Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA)** handle most digital policy. Neither has had a dedicated AI unit until recently, and there's still a shortage of technical expertise within the government to actually evaluate or regulate AI systems. Organisations like the **National Innovation Centre** and **NAAMII** (Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research) have been doing AI-related work, but these efforts often run parallel to policy processes rather than feeding into them.

So the picture is mixed. Nepal has taken a real step with the AI Policy 2082, but it still lacks a comprehensive data protection law, clear algorithmic accountability rules, and -- most critically -- the institutional muscle to enforce any of this. Policies on paper are one thing. Making them work in a country where government offices in many districts still struggle with basic internet connectivity is another.

## 3. Opportunities of AI for Nepal

It's easy to focus on risks, but AI genuinely offers Nepal some opportunities that could make a real difference -- especially in sectors where the country has struggled for decades.

### Agriculture

About 60% of Nepal's workforce is in agriculture, but the sector contributes only around 25% of GDP (CBS, 2021). Productivity is low. Landholdings are small and fragmented. Farmers in places like the Terai or the mid-hills often make planting decisions based on tradition or guesswork because they don't have access to timely, reliable information.

AI could change some of that. Satellite imagery processed through machine learning can track crop health and predict yields -- giving farmers and agricultural extension workers a heads-up about disease outbreaks or drought stress before it's too late. India and Bangladesh have already piloted mobile-based AI advisory apps that give farmers localised advice on when to plant, how much fertiliser to use, and how to deal with pests (FAO, 2022). There's no reason something similar couldn't work in Nepal, especially if it's built in Nepali and other local languages.

Here's a practical example that I think about: a smallholder rice farmer in Morang district currently has very little way of knowing what price their crop will fetch in Biratnagar versus Kathmandu. An AI-powered market information system on a basic smartphone could give them that data in real time. That's not futuristic -- it's doable, and it could directly cut into the middleman problem that's been squeezing rural incomes for years.

### Disaster Management

Nepal is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Earthquakes, floods, landslides, glacial lake outburst floods -- the list is long. The 2015 earthquake alone killed nearly 9,000 people and caused damage estimated at around NPR 706 billion, roughly a third of the country's GDP at the time (NPC, 2015).

AI can help here in very concrete ways. Machine learning models can process data from weather stations, river gauges, and satellites to produce better flood and landslide forecasts. Organisations like **ICIMOD** (International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development) have been working on remote sensing and AI-based tools for monitoring glacial lakes across the Himalayan belt, which is directly relevant to Nepal's GLOF risk. After a disaster hits, AI-powered image recognition can analyse drone and satellite photos to quickly figure out where the damage is worst and where to send help first -- something that could have sped up the response during the 2015 earthquake.

In both these areas, AI doesn't just offer efficiency. It has the potential to close information gaps that have kept Nepal's most vulnerable communities at a disadvantage.

## 4. Risks and Governance Challenges

That said, I don't think we should be naive about what AI means for a country like Nepal. The risks are real, and they're not just technical -- they're deeply political and social.

### Data Protection and Privacy

Nepal still doesn't have a comprehensive data protection law. The Individual Privacy Act 2075 exists, but it's thin -- it doesn't address automated decision-making, algorithmic profiling, or cross-border data flows. That's a problem. The government is digitising citizen records through programmes like the national ID system, and private companies are collecting data through apps and platforms every day. Without strong legal safeguards, there's nothing stopping this data from being misused -- for surveillance, for profiling, or just for commercial gain without anyone's consent (Privacy International, 2023). The AI Policy 2082 acknowledges data governance as important, but until an actual data protection law is passed and enforced, that acknowledgment doesn't mean much in practice.

### Algorithmic Bias and Exclusion

Most AI systems are trained on data from wealthy, English-speaking countries. They don't work equally well everywhere. I've tried using AI translation tools for Nepali and the results are, frankly, rough. For languages like Maithili, Bhojpuri, or Tamang, support is almost nonexistent. If Nepal starts using AI in public services -- say, for screening welfare applications or processing government forms -- systems that don't understand local languages or contexts could end up excluding the very people they're supposed to serve.

Credit scoring is another worry. If banks or fintech companies adopt AI-based lending algorithms built for markets where everyone has a formal credit history, they'll automatically disadvantage Nepal's massive informal sector -- street vendors, daily wage workers, women running small home-based businesses. These people aren't uncreditworthy; they're just invisible to the data (Eubanks, 2018).

### Digital Divide

Nepal's internet penetration is around 75%, which sounds decent until you look at the distribution. Urban areas, especially the Kathmandu Valley, are relatively well-connected. But go to Humla, Dolpa, or parts of the far-western hills, and connectivity drops off sharply (NTA, 2024). AI-driven services could easily widen the gap between connected and unconnected Nepal. A farmer in Bhaktapur might benefit from an AI crop advisory app; a farmer in Jumla might not even have the signal to download it. If AI governance doesn't actively address this divide, it risks creating a two-tier system.

There's also the dependency question. Nepal relies almost entirely on foreign platforms -- Google, Meta, TikTok, Chinese tech providers. The decisions about how these platforms' algorithms work, what content they promote or suppress, and where they store Nepali users' data are all made abroad. That's a sovereignty issue, and it's one that Nepal's political establishment hasn't seriously grappled with yet.

### Misinformation and Political Manipulation

Nepal's politics are complicated. Coalition governments, frequent party splits, ethnic and regional tensions. AI-generated deepfakes and synthetic media can exploit these fault lines. We saw how social media shaped the 2017 and 2022 election cycles; AI-powered tools make it cheaper and faster to produce convincing misinformation (Freedom House, 2024). In a country where political trust is already fragile, this could do serious damage to democratic processes.

## 5. Policy Recommendations

Given everything above, I'd propose four recommendations that I think are realistic for Nepal's current capacity and political context:

**1. Pass a Comprehensive Data Protection Law.** The AI Policy 2082 is a good start, but it can't function properly without a companion data protection law. Nepal needs to move beyond the limited Privacy Act 2075 and pass legislation with specific provisions for automated decision-making, algorithmic transparency, and people's right to know how AI systems affect them. An independent Data Protection Authority with real enforcement power is essential. Nepal can learn from frameworks like the EU's GDPR, but whatever it builds needs to fit Nepal's resources and realities (UNESCO, 2021).

**2. Turn the AI Policy 2082 into Action with Clear Implementation Plans.** Having a policy is one thing; implementing it is another. The government needs to develop specific action plans with timelines, budgets, and accountability mechanisms. This means creating a dedicated AI coordination body within MoCIT, setting up sector-specific guidelines (starting with health, agriculture, and public services), and running regular public consultations so the policy doesn't just become a document that sits in a drawer.

**3. Invest in Nepali-Language AI and Local Research Capacity.** If AI is going to work for Nepal, it needs to work in Nepali -- and ideally in other national languages too. The government should fund research at institutions like NAAMII, Tribhuvan University, and Kathmandu University, with a focus on locally relevant applications: agriculture, disaster prediction, and healthcare. The goal should be growing Nepal's own AI talent pool rather than depending entirely on foreign expertise and platforms.

**4. Push for Regional Cooperation on AI Governance.** Nepal doesn't have to figure this out alone. A South Asian dialogue on AI governance -- through SAARC, BIMSTEC, or even bilateral channels with India and Bangladesh -- could help smaller countries like Nepal negotiate better terms with global tech companies, share regulatory ideas, and coordinate on cross-border issues like data flows and platform accountability.

## 6. Conclusion

AI is already in Nepal. It's in the apps people use, the platforms they scroll, the systems that process their data. The question isn't whether Nepal will engage with AI -- it already does. The question is whether it'll do so on its own terms.

The National AI Policy 2082 is a genuinely promising step, and it puts Nepal on the map as a country that's at least trying to think about this seriously. But a policy document alone won't solve the problems I've discussed -- the missing data protection law, the digital divide, the algorithmic bias risks, the foreign dependency. What Nepal needs now is follow-through: implementation plans, institutional capacity, and the political will to treat AI governance as a development priority rather than a tech sideshow.

Having studied the AI governance module, I've come to think that countries like Nepal actually have an advantage in one specific way: they can learn from other countries' mistakes. Nepal doesn't have to repeat the EU's decade-long regulatory struggle or copy Silicon Valley's move-fast-and-break-things approach. It can build something that fits its own context -- a framework that's inclusive, realistic, and grounded in what its people actually need.
