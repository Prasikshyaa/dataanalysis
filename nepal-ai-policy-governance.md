# Artificial Intelligence in Nepal: Policy, Governance, and the Path Forward

---

## 1. Introduction

At its simplest, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about machines doing things we used to think only humans could do -- recognising faces, translating languages, predicting weather, even writing essays. It's not magic. It's software built on data and algorithms, and it's already woven into daily life. Every time someone in Kathmandu scrolls through TikTok or gets a loan approved through a fintech app, AI is working behind the scenes.

But here's the thing: AI isn't just a technology question. It's a governance question. Who decides how these systems work? Whose data feeds them? Who benefits, and who gets left out? For Nepal -- a federal democratic republic with a GDP per capita of around USD 1,336 and about 17% of its population living in multidimensional poverty (CBS, 2021) -- these aren't abstract concerns. They're urgent.

I got into this topic through the AI governance module, and what struck me was how much of the global AI conversation assumes a level of infrastructure and institutional capacity that countries like Nepal don't have. This paper looks at where Nepal stands on AI policy, what's at stake, and what realistic steps the government can take. My argument is straightforward -- Nepal can't afford to passively consume AI built elsewhere. It needs its own approach, one that fits its economy, its politics, and its people.

## 2. Nepal's Current Digital and AI Policy Landscape

Nepal's journey with digital governance has been slow. The **Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) 2063 (2008)** was the main legislation for years, covering electronic signatures, cybercrime, and online transactions. It was fine for its time, but it was written before anyone in Nepali policymaking was thinking about algorithms or machine learning. The **National ICT Policy 2015** pushed for e-governance and broadband expansion but made no mention of AI.

The **Digital Nepal Framework 2019**, developed with World Bank support, was a step forward. It identified eight sectors for digital transformation -- agriculture, health, education, energy, tourism, finance, urban infrastructure, and government services (World Bank, 2019). But it mostly treated technology as a delivery tool rather than a governance challenge. It didn't ask: what happens when an algorithm makes a wrong call about someone's credit? Who's responsible?

On data protection, Nepal has the **Individual Privacy Act 2075 (2018)**, but it's limited -- it wasn't built with AI, big data, or automated profiling in mind. A broader **Draft Data Protection Bill** has been discussed for years without being enacted, leaving a real gap (Privacy International, 2023).

The big development is the **National Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) Policy 2082**, approved by the government in 2025. Nepal now has a dedicated AI policy on paper -- ahead of several regional neighbours. It covers using AI for economic growth, public services, and domestic capacity-building, and touches on ethical use and data governance (Government of Nepal, 2025). I was honestly surprised when I first heard about it. The policy exists, though, and the real question is implementation.

Institutionally, the **Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT)** and the **Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA)** lead digital policy, but neither has deep AI expertise. Organisations like the **National Innovation Centre** and **NAAMII** (Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research) do AI-related work, but their efforts often run parallel to policy rather than shaping it.

The picture is mixed. The AI Policy 2082 is a genuine milestone, but Nepal still lacks a comprehensive data protection law, algorithmic accountability rules, and the institutional muscle to enforce what's already on paper.

## 3. Opportunities of AI for Nepal

AI genuinely offers Nepal opportunities in sectors where the country has struggled for decades.

### Agriculture

About 60% of Nepal's workforce depends on agriculture, yet the sector contributes only around 25% of GDP (CBS, 2021). Productivity is low, landholdings are fragmented, and farmers often rely on guesswork because they lack timely information. AI could change that. Satellite imagery processed through machine learning can track crop health and predict yields, giving farmers early warning about disease or drought. India and Bangladesh have already piloted mobile AI advisory apps offering localised planting and pest management advice (FAO, 2022). There's no reason Nepal couldn't adapt something similar in Nepali and other local languages.

A practical example: a rice farmer in Morang district has almost no way of comparing prices in Biratnagar versus Kathmandu before selling. An AI-powered market app on a basic smartphone could give that data in real time -- directly cutting into the middleman problem that squeezes rural incomes.

### Disaster Management

Nepal is among the world's most disaster-prone countries. The 2015 earthquake killed 8,856 people and caused damage estimated at NPR 706 billion -- roughly a third of GDP (NPC, 2015). Machine learning models can process weather station, river gauge, and satellite data to produce better flood and landslide forecasts. Organisations like **ICIMOD** have been working on remote sensing tools for monitoring Himalayan glacial lakes, directly relevant to Nepal's glacial lake outburst flood risk. After disasters, AI image recognition can analyse drone and satellite photos to quickly identify the worst-hit areas and guide where help goes first.

In both sectors, AI can close information gaps that have long disadvantaged Nepal's most vulnerable communities.

## 4. Risks and Governance Challenges

The risks are real, and they go well beyond technical problems.

### Data Protection and Privacy

Nepal lacks a comprehensive data protection law. The Privacy Act 2075 exists but doesn't cover automated decision-making, algorithmic profiling, or cross-border data flows. The government is digitising citizen records through the national ID programme, and private companies collect data through apps daily. Without strong safeguards, this data can be misused for surveillance or commercial exploitation without consent (Privacy International, 2023). The AI Policy 2082 flags data governance as important, but without an enforceable law backing it up, that means little.

### Algorithmic Bias and Exclusion

Most AI systems are trained on data from wealthy, English-speaking countries. I've tried AI translation tools for Nepali -- the results are rough. For Maithili, Bhojpuri, or Tamang, support barely exists. If Nepal deploys AI in public services without addressing this, it risks excluding the people who need those services most. AI credit-scoring is another concern: algorithms built for formal markets will automatically disadvantage Nepal's massive informal sector -- street vendors, daily wage workers, women with home-based businesses who simply don't appear in conventional financial data (Eubanks, 2018).

### Digital Divide and Foreign Dependency

NTA reports data service penetration above 80%, but actual meaningful access varies sharply (NTA, 2024). Kathmandu Valley is well-connected; Humla or Dolpa, not so much. AI services risk widening that gap. Nepal also depends almost entirely on foreign platforms -- Google, Meta, TikTok. Decisions about algorithms, content moderation, and data storage affecting Nepali users are made in corporate offices abroad with no accountability to Nepali institutions.

### Misinformation

Nepal's politics -- coalition governments, party splits, ethnic tensions -- are complicated. AI-generated deepfakes can exploit these fault lines. Social media already shaped the 2017 and 2022 elections; AI tools make producing convincing misinformation faster and cheaper (Freedom House, 2024). That's dangerous for a country where political trust is already thin.

## 5. Policy Recommendations

Four recommendations that I think fit Nepal's current capacity:

**1. Pass a Comprehensive Data Protection Law.** The AI Policy 2082 needs a companion data protection law with provisions for automated decision-making, algorithmic transparency, and an independent enforcement authority. Nepal can draw on frameworks like the EU's GDPR but must tailor them to its own resources (UNESCO, 2021).

**2. Build Implementation Plans for the AI Policy 2082.** The policy needs timelines, budgets, and accountability. A dedicated AI coordination body within MoCIT, sector-specific guidelines, and regular public consultations would keep it from becoming a shelf document.

**3. Invest in Nepali-Language AI and Local Research.** AI has to work in Nepali and other national languages to be useful here. Funding institutions like NAAMII, Tribhuvan University, and Kathmandu University for locally relevant AI research -- agriculture, disaster prediction, healthcare -- would grow domestic talent instead of deepening foreign dependency.

**4. Push for Regional Cooperation.** A South Asian AI governance dialogue through SAARC or BIMSTEC could help smaller countries like Nepal negotiate with global tech firms and share regulatory approaches on data flows and platform accountability.

## 6. Conclusion

AI is already in Nepal -- in the apps, the platforms, the systems processing people's data. The question isn't whether Nepal engages with AI. It already does. The question is whether it does so on its own terms.

The AI Policy 2082 is a real milestone. But without follow-through -- a data protection law, institutional capacity, and political will -- it risks staying on paper. Having studied the AI governance module, I've come to think Nepal has one clear advantage: it can learn from other countries' mistakes rather than repeating them. It doesn't need to copy the EU or Silicon Valley. It can build something that fits its own context -- inclusive, realistic, and grounded in what its people actually need.
