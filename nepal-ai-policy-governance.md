# Artificial Intelligence in Nepal: Policy, Governance, and the Path Forward

---

## 1. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capacity of computer systems to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence, including pattern recognition, language understanding, decision-making, and predictive analysis. While AI is often discussed in technical terms, its most consequential dimensions are political and social: who controls AI systems, who benefits from them, and who bears the risks they create. For a country like Nepal -- a low-income, landlocked nation navigating a federal democratic transition -- AI policy is not merely a matter of technological modernisation but a question of sovereignty, equity, and governance capacity.

Nepal stands at a critical juncture. The rapid global diffusion of AI-powered tools into sectors such as finance, healthcare, education, and public administration means that Nepal is already being shaped by AI, whether or not it has policies to govern it. Nepali citizens interact with AI through social media algorithms, mobile banking, and automated content moderation, yet there is no comprehensive legal or institutional framework to govern these systems. Without deliberate policy action, Nepal risks importing AI systems designed for vastly different contexts, deepening existing inequalities, and ceding governance authority to foreign technology corporations.

This paper critically examines Nepal's current digital governance landscape, identifies the opportunities and risks that AI presents, and proposes context-specific policy recommendations. The central argument is that Nepal must pursue a proactive, inclusive, and sovereignty-conscious approach to AI governance -- one that prioritises development needs, protects fundamental rights, and builds domestic institutional capacity rather than passively adopting frameworks designed elsewhere.

## 2. Nepal's Current Digital and AI Policy Landscape

Nepal's engagement with digital governance has been gradual and largely reactive. The **Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) 2063 (2008)** remains the primary legislation governing digital activities, covering electronic signatures, cybercrime, and online transactions. However, the ETA was drafted before the AI era and does not address algorithmic decision-making, automated profiling, or machine learning systems (Ministry of Communication and Information Technology [MoCIT], 2019). The **National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy 2015** outlined ambitions for e-governance, digital literacy, and broadband expansion, but it made no reference to AI or data-driven governance systems (Government of Nepal, 2015).

More recently, the **Digital Nepal Framework 2019**, developed with support from the World Bank, identified eight priority sectors for digital transformation -- including agriculture, health, education, energy, tourism, finance, urban infrastructure, and government services. While this framework acknowledged the role of emerging technologies, it treated AI primarily as a tool for service delivery rather than as a governance challenge requiring regulation and oversight (World Bank, 2019). A **Draft Data Protection Bill** has been under discussion for several years, but as of early 2026 it has not been enacted into law, leaving Nepal without a statutory framework for personal data protection -- a foundational prerequisite for responsible AI deployment (Privacy International, 2023).

Institutionally, the **Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT)** and the **Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA)** are the principal bodies overseeing digital policy. However, neither body has a dedicated AI unit, and there is limited technical expertise within the bureaucracy to evaluate AI systems or their societal impacts. The **National Innovation Centre** and various university research labs have undertaken AI-related projects, but these efforts remain fragmented and largely disconnected from policy processes (Adhikari & Panthi, 2022).

The gaps are significant. Nepal lacks: (a) a national AI strategy or policy, (b) a data protection law, (c) algorithmic accountability mechanisms, (d) sector-specific AI guidelines, and (e) institutional capacity to monitor and regulate AI systems. This regulatory vacuum means that AI is being deployed in Nepal -- through foreign platforms, development projects, and private-sector initiatives -- without meaningful public oversight.

## 3. Opportunities of AI for Nepal

Despite the governance challenges, AI presents substantial opportunities for Nepal, particularly in addressing long-standing development constraints in **agriculture** and **disaster management**.

### Agriculture

Agriculture employs approximately 60% of Nepal's workforce and contributes around 25% of GDP, yet it remains characterised by low productivity, fragmented landholdings, and vulnerability to climate variability (Central Bureau of Statistics [CBS], 2021). AI-powered tools could significantly enhance agricultural decision-making. Satellite imagery analysed through machine learning can provide crop health assessments and yield predictions, enabling farmers and extension workers to respond proactively to disease outbreaks or drought stress. Mobile-based AI advisory systems, already piloted in India and Bangladesh, could be adapted for Nepal to deliver localised recommendations on planting times, fertiliser use, and pest management in Nepali and other local languages (FAO, 2022). Furthermore, AI-driven market information systems could help smallholder farmers access real-time price data, reducing the exploitation by intermediaries that depresses rural incomes.

### Disaster Management

Nepal is among the world's most disaster-prone countries, facing earthquakes, floods, landslides, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). AI can strengthen early warning systems by processing data from weather stations, river gauges, and satellite sensors to produce more accurate and timely flood and landslide forecasts. The **Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM)** has begun integrating machine learning models into flood prediction, and organisations like the **International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)** have piloted AI-based tools for monitoring glacial lakes in the Himalayan region (ICIMOD, 2023). During disaster response, AI-powered image recognition can analyse aerial and satellite imagery to rapidly assess damage, identify affected populations, and optimise resource allocation -- capabilities that proved critical during the 2015 earthquake response and could be institutionalised for future events (Sharma et al., 2020).

In both sectors, AI offers not just efficiency gains but the potential to address structural information asymmetries that have historically disadvantaged Nepal's rural and marginalised populations.

## 4. Risks and Governance Challenges

The deployment of AI in Nepal's context carries risks that are as much social and political as they are technical.

### Data Protection and Privacy

The absence of a data protection law means that personal data collected by AI systems -- whether through health apps, financial platforms, or government databases -- lacks legal safeguards. Nepal's ongoing digitisation of citizen records, including the national ID programme, creates large datasets that could be misused for surveillance, profiling, or commercial exploitation without informed consent. The power asymmetry between data-collecting entities (often foreign corporations or international organisations) and Nepali data subjects is stark (Privacy International, 2023).

### Algorithmic Bias and Exclusion

AI systems trained on data from high-income, English-speaking contexts may perform poorly or discriminate when applied in Nepal. Natural language processing tools, for instance, have minimal support for Nepali, Maithili, or other languages spoken across the country, risking the exclusion of non-English-speaking populations from AI-driven services. Credit scoring algorithms, if adopted without contextual adaptation, could entrench biases against informal-sector workers, women, or rural populations who lack conventional financial histories (Eubanks, 2018).

### Digital Divide and Dependency

Only approximately 75% of Nepal's population has internet access, and connectivity is significantly weaker in mountainous and rural areas (NTA, 2024). AI-driven services risk widening the gap between connected urban populations and underserved communities. Moreover, Nepal's near-total reliance on foreign AI platforms -- from Google and Meta to Chinese technology providers -- raises sovereignty concerns. Decisions about content moderation, data storage, and algorithmic design that affect Nepali citizens are made in corporate headquarters abroad, with minimal accountability to Nepali institutions or democratic processes (Haggart & Tusikov, 2023).

### Misinformation and Political Manipulation

AI-generated deepfakes and synthetic media pose particular risks in Nepal's multi-ethnic, politically fragmented society, where disinformation can inflame communal tensions and undermine electoral integrity. The 2022 and 2024 election cycles demonstrated the growing role of social media in Nepali politics, and AI tools make the production of misleading content faster, cheaper, and more convincing (Freedom House, 2024).

## 5. Policy Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, four concrete policy recommendations are proposed for Nepal's AI governance framework:

**1. Enact a Comprehensive Data Protection Law.** Nepal should prioritise the passage of its Draft Data Protection Bill, incorporating provisions specifically addressing automated decision-making, algorithmic transparency, and the right to explanation. This law should establish an independent Data Protection Authority with enforcement powers and the technical capacity to audit AI systems. International frameworks such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the African Union's Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection can serve as reference points, but the law must be tailored to Nepal's institutional capacity and enforcement realities (UNESCO, 2021).

**2. Develop a National AI Strategy with Multi-Stakeholder Participation.** The Government of Nepal, through MoCIT, should develop a national AI strategy through an inclusive consultative process involving civil society, academia, the private sector, and representatives of marginalised communities. This strategy should identify priority sectors for AI deployment, establish ethical guidelines, and create institutional mechanisms for ongoing oversight. Countries like Rwanda and Uruguay, which have developed AI strategies suited to their development contexts, offer useful models for Nepal (Oxford Insights, 2023).

**3. Invest in Domestic AI Capacity and Multilingual AI Development.** Nepal should invest in AI education and research within its universities and technical institutions, with targeted funding for AI applications in Nepali languages and locally relevant domains such as agriculture and disaster risk reduction. Partnerships with organisations like ICIMOD, NAAMII (Nepal Applied Mathematics and Informatics Institute for Research), and international academic institutions can help build a critical mass of AI expertise (Adhikari & Panthi, 2022).

**4. Establish a Regional AI Governance Dialogue.** Nepal should advocate for a South Asian regional dialogue on AI governance, potentially through SAARC or BIMSTEC, to address cross-border issues such as data flows, platform regulation, and shared technology standards. Regional cooperation can amplify the negotiating power of smaller nations vis-a-vis global technology companies and provide a forum for sharing regulatory innovations (Aaronson, 2021).

## 6. Conclusion

Nepal's encounter with AI is already underway, driven not by domestic policy choice but by the global diffusion of AI-powered platforms and systems. The absence of a national AI strategy, a data protection law, and institutional capacity for AI governance leaves Nepal in a reactive posture, vulnerable to the risks of unregulated technology adoption while failing to fully capture AI's development potential. This paper has argued that Nepal requires a proactive, context-sensitive governance approach -- one that enacts foundational legal protections, builds domestic technical capacity, ensures inclusive participation in policy design, and engages with regional and global governance processes from a position of informed sovereignty. The challenge is significant, but Nepal's tradition of civil society engagement, its vibrant technology community, and its federal governance architecture provide a foundation upon which a responsible AI governance framework can be built.
